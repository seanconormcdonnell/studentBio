	<p>I grew up in Norman, Oklahoma until the age 10. Once our family relocated to Texas I started to play guitar with a kid from our new neighborhood. By the time I got into high school I was already heavily persuing music. I played on the drumline, but slowly transitioned into playing guitar more. At the age 19 I left college, where I was studying audio engineering, to sign a record deal with an independent lable. After four or five years of touring and bartending between the month long road trips, I decided to find something else to earn income. Although I will continue to play music, I do not plan on bartending anymore. Now I am here at SMU to further my education in hopes that it is the beginning of an exciting new career.</p>
